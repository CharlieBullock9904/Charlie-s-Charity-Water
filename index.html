      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        charity: water was founded in 2006 by Scott Harrison, a former nightclub promoter who turned his life around after volunteering on a hospital ship in West Africa. What started as a personal mission to help the 703 million people living without clean water has grown into a global movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're a nonprofit organization bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries. 100% of public donations directly fund water projects, while operational costs are covered by a separate group of donors.

We know how to solve the problem, and we make progress every day thanks to the help of local partners and generous supporters. If we work together, we believe everyone will have access to life's most basic need within our lifetime.
